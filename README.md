+ Adjust promotional strategies to maximize revenue without significantly impacting profit margins.

**Identify and Nurture Top Customers**
+ Create or improve loyalty programs to reward frequent buyers and top customers based on how much they spend, encouraging them to keep buying.

**Sales Analysis and Forecasting**
